mglearn improper processing plot needs matplotlib v2.0 update
fix mlxtend dependency?
add xgboost dependency
add imbalance learn dependency <----
fix openml dependency in imbalanced data -> csv interface
pca faces plot broken
gp exercise impossibly hard
gp slides really bad, too :-/
fancyimpute?
create requirements file, add instructions to install using requirements file

text data too slow?

compare my outlier detection with Alex from scipy

hashing vecorizer in out-of-core
different text dataset for exercise?
box-cox?
consolidate outlier detection here with aml outlier detection notebook slides?

get rid of preamble and mglearn
add deep learning with keras to deep learning
aclImdb remove unsupervised folder
fix PCA decomposition plot
add gp back in


exercises missing
------------------
5 out of core? Makes no sense?
extra imbalanced data
extra missing values


solutions missing
------------------
2 pipeline
3 evaluation
4 text data
extra dimensionality reduction
extra gradient boosting
extra deep learning
extra outlier detection
extra topic modelling
